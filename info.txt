How to use git
---------------
Prerequisite: 
You already have git installed
You already have git bash installed

1. In Chrome, open git hub website: https://github.com/dashboard
2. On the left side, Click on "New" button. We are trying to create a repo (repositories) (just need to do once to create a new repo)
3. In the Repository name, give a name. No spaces. Can use underscores. 
4. Find clone tab. It starts with https://github.com/ and ends with .git. Copy the URL
5.1 Create a directory (folder) for your project. Say Desktop. Give the directory a name, say Week1_Code.
5.2 Go to the directory Week1_Code.
6. Right click and Open Git Bash Here
7. Run the command: git clone <URL>. For example: git clone https://github.com/Coderaj240/Week1_Code.git (need to do only once for each repo)
8. We will continue working on the Git Bash. cd to cloned directory. For example: cd Week1_Code
9. Anything you change in this directory, it will show up as changes. For testing, create a test file called test.txt and add some text in it, like "Hello"
10. Use the command to see changes. git status
11. You will see the added file. Now, you need to add the file to repo/GitHub. Run the command: git add <file name>. For example. git add test.txt
11. To commit (save the changed in repo), use the command: git commit -m "Added a file with some text"
12. Push the commit/changes. git push
13. Go to the URL (GitHub), you will see the change. 
14. If you need to change anything, repeat from step 8 to 12.
